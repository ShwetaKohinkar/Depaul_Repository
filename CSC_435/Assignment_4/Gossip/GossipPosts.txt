Postings:Top of FormHi  Rohan,Have you implemented the "calculate" function ? If yes, you must be triggering this event from one node and this event was getting passed on to the all the entire network. Same way, when you want to kill the entire network, trigger some event in the same manner with some flag value, read this flag on other nodes and kill the current node. Before killing the current node, send the event to other node to do the same until it reaches to the end of network.Bottom of Form
